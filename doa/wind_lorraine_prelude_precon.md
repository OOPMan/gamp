# Dawn of Ashes Prelude: Wind Lorraine Pre-Constructed Deck Automa

## Contents

## Introduction
Welcome to the rulebook for the Automa for the Wind Lorraine Pre-Constructed Deck from the Dawn of Ashes Prelude set.

## Core Concepts
This section details some core concepts involved in playing with this Automa.

#### The Automa Hand
The [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) is a new Zone that is used to manage the cards available to the Automa for Activation 
during the [Main Phase](#main-phase). It is analogous to the Player's Hand, except that is part of the 
[Play Area](#prepare-the-play-area) on the table.

Cards are drawn from the Main Deck are placed **face-down** in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand). During the 
[Main Phase](#main-phase) the Player will reveal cards in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand), but should otherwise 
avoid peeking at them unless instructed to do so by some effect (This includes during the Draw Phase).

If the Player is forced to look at the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) then they should shuffle it once they are done in 
order to ensure that their knowledge of its contents and the position of those contents is reduced. Similarly, if some 
effect would force the Automa to discard a card from its Hand the Player will need to first shuffle the Automa Hand 
before selected a card to be discarded.

### The Automa Hand Graveyard
In addition to the normal Graveyard, the Automa has a second, separate Graveyard that is used during the
[Main Phase](#main-phase). The [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) is not considered to exist by anything 
in the game and thus can not be the target of any Actions, Abilities or Effects. Cards must **always** be placed face-up 
in the [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) in order to avoid mistaking them for being part of the 
[Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand).

If the Automa needs to Draw a Card and its Main Deck is empty, shuffle the [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) 
to form a new Main Deck and then resolve the Draw Card effect. If the Automa's Main Deck is empty and the 
[Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) is also empty, the Draw Card effect will result in the Automa losing 
as expected.

This system exists to prevent the Automa from prematurely losing due to the mechanics used in the [Main Phase](#main-phase), 
which result in cards being discarded to the [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) at a fairly rapid rate.

### The Automa Reaction Deck
In addition to the Main Deck and the Material Deck, the Automa has a third, separate Reaction Deck. This deck is not
considered to exist by anything in the game and thus can not be the target of any Actions, Abilities or Effects.

Whenever an Ally controlled by the Automa receives enough Damage that it would Die, draw a card from the Automa Reaction 
Deck. If a [Favorable Winds](https://index.gatcg.com/card/favorable-winds) is drawn, the Automa immediately plays this 
card, ignoring the Reserve Cost. If any other card is drawn, Discard it to the [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard).

### Optional Abilities/Costs
Where possible the Automa will **ALWAYS** pay Optional Costs and/or Activate Optional Abilities **as soon as possible**
as long as doing so is of benefit to the Automa. 

Unlike the other rules, this one is a bit more vague and open to interpretation. Ultimately it's up to the Player to
decide what is of benefit to the Automa.

## Automa Turn
When it is the Automa's turn, the Player executes gameplay for the Automa according the rules defined below for each 
phase.

### Wake Up Phase
The Wake up Phase proceeds as normal for the Automa.

### Materialize Phase
During the Materialize Phase, check the face-up card on the top of the Automa's Material deck. If the Automa can
afford to pay the Memory cost to Materialize this card, do so now.

If some effect during the Automa's previous turn resulted in a card in the Automa's Memory being revealed to the Player
(For example, the Automa played [Wind Cutter](https://index.gatcg.com/card/wind-cutter)), be sure to shuffle the
cards in the Automa's Memory before Banishing cards to pay the Memory cost.

If this is the Automa's first turn, and it is Materializing its first Champion, place the Champion in the **right-most** 
position in the Field, otherwise place the Materialized Card it to the immediate **left** of the Automa's Champion (unless
it is a Champion in which case you should place it stacked with the current Champion), shifting any cards in the Field 
to the **left** in order to do so.

### Recollection Phase
Move all cards in the Automa's Memory to the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand). Assuming the suggested 
[Play Area](#prepare-the-play-area) layout is being used, this is achieved by simply sliding the cards down from the 
Memory to the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand), being sure to avoid placing cards into the 
[Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard).

### Draw Phase
Draw a card face-down to the **left-hand** side of the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand), next to the 
[Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard). If there are any cards already in the 
[Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) they will **shift right** in order to make space for the new card.

### Main Phase
#### Activate Cards from the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand)
Starting with the **left-most** card in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand), do the following:

1. Flip the card face-up and check its Reserve Cost
2. If the Automa...
   1. ...*is not capable* of paying the Reserve Cost for the Revealed Card *OR* there are *no valid [Targets](#targeting)* 
      for the Revealed Card, place it in [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) and draw a new Card from the 
      Main Deck to the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) in the position that the Revealed Card resided in before being 
      Revealed. This newly drawn Card is considered to be part of the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) for the purposes 
      of paying Reserve Costs but *can not be evaluated for Activation*. It is drawn simply to ensure that failed 
      Activations do not result in the size of the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) changing
   2. ...*is capable* of paying the Reserve Cost for the revealed Card using the remaining Cards in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) 
      as well as any cards in the Graveyard with the **Floating Memory** keyword, do so and Activate the Card. The Automa
      will prefer to pay Reserve Costs using **Floating Memory**. When selecting cards to move to the Memory in order to
      pay a Reserve Cost, start with the **left-most face-down** card in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) and proceed 
      right across the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) until the Reserve Cost has been paid. If the Revealed Card is an
      Ally place it in the **left-most** position in the Field, shifting any cards in the Field to the **right** in order
      to do so, if necessary.
3. Repeat this process with the next **left-most** card in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) that was not placed as a
   result of evaluating Step 2.1 of this process. If cards were drawn to the hand as a result of Activation in Step 2.2 
   these cards can be evaluated for Activation, but be sure not to accidentally check for Activation of any cards
   placed during Step 2.1 (Marking them temporarily with a token or shifting their position slightly is recommended)

##### Example 
TODO

#### Activate Abilities
Starting with the **left-most** card in the Automa's Field, do the following:

1. Determine whether...
   1. The Automa can pay any costs required to Activate the Ability
   2. The Automa can designate a valid target for the Ability
   3. Activating the Ability would be of benefit to the Automa
2. If the Ability passes all the aforementioned checks, Activate and resolve the Ability
3. Repeat this process with the next **left-most** card in the Automa's Field

##### Example
TODO

#### Attack with Champion
If the Automa's Champion is capable of doing so, it Attacks the Human Player's Champion.

#### Attack with Allies
Starting with the **left-most** Ally in the Automa's Field, each Ally that is capable doing so Attacks the Human 
Player's Champion. Remember, Allies with [Intercept](#intercept) will not Attack if the Human Player has any Allies in 
the Field.

### End Phase
The End Phase proceeds as normal for the Automa.

## Mechanics
The follow section details specific game mechanics that need to be handled differently for the Automa

### Intercept
The Automa will not Attack with Allies that have the Intercept if the Human Player has any Allies on the Field. 

During the Human Players turn, if the Human Player Attacks the Automa's Champion and the Automa has an Awake Ally with
Intercept, it will always attempt to intercept the Attack with that Ally. 

The Automa will never use Intercept to redirect Attacks directed at other Allies.

### Glimpse
The Automa skips resolving Glimpse entirely. As a result, [Scry the Skies](https://index.gatcg.com/card/scry-the-skies)
will simply draw the top card of the Main Deck to the Automa's Memory.
