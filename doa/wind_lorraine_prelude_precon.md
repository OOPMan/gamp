# Dawn of Ashes: Wind Lorraine Pre-Constructed Deck Automa

## Contents

## Introduction
Welcome to the rulebook for the Automa for the Wind Lorraine Pre-Constructed Deck from the Dawn of Ashes set.

## Core Concepts
#### The Automa Hand
Much like when playing against a Human opponent, the Automa Hand is Hidden Information and as such the cards in the
Automa Hand must always be kept face-down during play.

During the [Play Cards](#play-cards) step of the [Main Phase](#main-phase) the Player will reveal cards in the
Automa Hand, but should otherwise avoid peeking at it unless instructed to do so by some effect. If the Player is
forced to look at the Automa Hand then they should shuffle it once they are done in order to ensure that their knowledge
of its contents and the position of those contents is reduced. Similarly, if some effect would force the Automa to
discard a card from its Hand the Player will need to first shuffle the Automa Hand before selected a card to be
discarded.

### The Automa Graveyard
In addition to the normal Graveyard, the Automa has a second, separate Graveyard that is used during the
[Play Cards](#play-cards) step of the [Main Phase](#main-phase). The Automa Graveyard is not considered to 
exist by anything in the game and thus can not be the target of any Actions, Abilities or Effects. Cards must always be 
placed face-up in the Automa Graveyard.

If the Automa needs to Draw a Card and its Main Deck is empty, shuffle the Automa Graveyard to form a new Main Deck
and then resolve the Draw Card effect. If the Automa's Main Deck is empty and the Graveyard is also empty,
the Draw Card effect will result in the Automa losing as expected.

This system exists to prevent the Automa from prematurely losing due to the mechanics used in the [Play Cards](#play-cards) 
step of the [Main Phase](#main-phase), which result in cards being discarded to the Automa Graveyard at a fairly rapid rate.
