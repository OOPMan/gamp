# Dawn of Ashes Prelude: Wind Lorraine Pre-Constructed Deck Automa

## Contents

## Introduction
Welcome to the rulebook for the Automa for the Wind Lorraine Pre-Constructed Deck from the Dawn of Ashes Prelude set.

## Core Concepts
This section details some core concepts involved in playing with this Automa.

#### The Automa Hand
The [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) is a new Zone that is used to manage the cards available to the Automa for Activation 
during the [Main Phase](#main-phase). It is analogous to the Player's Hand, except that is part of the 
[Play Area](#prepare-the-play-area) on the table.

Cards are drawn from the Main Deck are placed **face-down** in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand). During the 
[Main Phase](#main-phase) the Player will reveal cards in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand), but should otherwise 
avoid peeking at them unless instructed to do so by some effect (This includes during the Draw Phase).

If the Player is forced to look at the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) then they should shuffle it once they are done in 
order to ensure that their knowledge of its contents and the position of those contents is reduced. Similarly, if some 
effect would force the Automa to discard a card from its Hand the Player will need to first shuffle the Automa Hand 
before selected a card to be discarded.

### The Automa Hand Graveyard
In addition to the normal Graveyard, the Automa has a second, separate Graveyard that is used during the
[Main Phase](#main-phase). The [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) is not considered to exist by anything 
in the game and thus can not be the target of any Actions, Abilities or Effects. Cards must **always** be placed face-up 
in the [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) in order to avoid mistaking them for being part of the 
[Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand).

If the Automa needs to Draw a Card and its Main Deck is empty, shuffle the [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) 
to form a new Main Deck and then resolve the Draw Card effect. If the Automa's Main Deck is empty and the 
[Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) is also empty, the Draw Card effect will result in the Automa losing 
as expected.

This system exists to prevent the Automa from prematurely losing due to the mechanics used in the [Main Phase](#main-phase), 
which result in cards being discarded to the [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard) at a fairly rapid rate.

### The Automa Reaction Deck
In addition to the Main Deck and the Material Deck, the Automa has a third, separate Reaction Deck. This deck is not
considered to exist by anything in the game and thus can not be the target of any Actions, Abilities or Effects.

Whenever an Ally controlled by the Automa receives enough Damage that it would Die, draw a card from the Automa Reaction 
Deck. If a [Favorable Winds](https://index.gatcg.com/card/favorable-winds) is drawn, the Automa immediately plays this 
card, ignoring the Reserve Cost. If any other card is drawn, Discard it to the [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard).

## Automa Turn
When it is the Automa's turn, the Player executes gameplay for the Automa according the rules defined below for each 
phase.

### Wake Up Phase
The Wake up Phase proceeds as normal for the Automa.

### Materialize Phase
During the Materialize Phase, check the face-up card on the top of the Automa's Material deck. If the Automa can
afford to pay the Memory cost to Materialize this card, do so now. 

If some effect during the Automa's previous turn resulted in a card in the Automa's Memory being revealed to the Player
(For example, the Automa played [Wind Cutter](https://index.gatcg.com/card/wind-cutter)), be sure to shuffle the
cards in the Automa's Memory before Banishing cards to pay the Memory cost.

### Recollection Phase
Move all cards in the Automa's Memory to the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand). Assuming the suggested 
[Play Area](#prepare-the-play-area) layout is being used, this is achieved by simply sliding the cards down from the 
Memory to the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand), being sure to avoid placing cards into the 
[Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard).

### Draw Phase
Draw a card face-down to the left-hand side of the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand), next to the 
[Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard). If there are any cards already in the 
[Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) they will shift right in order to make space for the new card.

### Main Phase
#### Activate Cards from the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand)
Starting with the **left-most** card in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand), do the following:

1. Flip the card face-up and check its Reserve Cost
2. If the Automa is capable of paying the Reserve Cost for the revealed Card using the remaining Cards in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) 
   as well as any cards in the Graveyard with the **Floating Memory** keyword, do so and Activate the Card. The Automa
   will prefer to pay Reserve Costs using **Floating Memory**. When selecting cards to move to the Memory in order to
   pay a Reserve Cost, start with the **left-most face-down** card in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) and proceed right 
   across the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) until the Reserve Cost has been paid
3. If the Automa is not capable of paying the Reserve Cost for the revealed Card, place it in [Automa Hand Graveyard](#the-automa-hand-graveyard)
   and draw a new card from the Main Deck to the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) in the position that the revealed card
   resided in before being revealed. This newly drawn card is considered to be part of the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand)
   for the purposes of paying Reserve Costs but can not be evaluated for Activation. It is drawn simply to ensure that
   failed Activations do not result in the size of the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) changing
4. Repeat this process with the next **left-most** card in the [Automa Hand](#the-automa-hand) that was not placed as a
   result of evaluating Step 3 of this process. If cards were drawn to the hand as a result of Activation in Step 2 
   these cards can be evaluated for Activation, but be sure not to accidentally check for Activation of any cards
   placed during Step 3 (Marking them temporarily with a token or shifting their position slightly is recommended)
